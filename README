INSTRUCTIONS:
in terminal, start the json server >> json-server --watch db.json


README to-do and format:
Choose a self-explanatory name.

Description:
This app lets you search through the table of elements by their properties. The table is populated by a database created from data stored in the data.txt file.

Directions:
There is a function in load.js to restore the data in db.json to it's original values if they get changed, and another function below that to add additional properties to the table as desired. The property names must be hard coded into the function body. There are arrays of elements in data.txt, many of which are still in progress that are meant to be used with these functions.

Notes:
This project can be further expanded by adding more groups and properties to the elements. See Nomenclature.txt file and data.txt for list of loose grouping structures which are currently very disorganizing.

The table is populated from data in the db.json file. renderElements() builds the table 




Contribute:

TO DO:

1. Finish processing the arrays to update the element objects

2. Figure out how to get the horizontal scroll bar in the table to work. 
    Right now, the data just resizes to fit the tableContainer. I want fixed column widths.
