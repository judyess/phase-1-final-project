Description:
This app lets you search through the table of elements by their properties. The table is populated by a database in db.json

Directions:
There is a function in load.js to restore the data in db.json to it's original values if they get changed, and another function below that to add additional properties to the table as desired. The property names must be hard coded into the function body. There are arrays of elements in data.txt, many of which are still in progress that are meant to be used with these functions.

Notes:
This project can be further expanded by adding more groups and properties to the elements. See Nomenclature.txt file and data.txt for list of loose grouping structures which are currently very disorganized.
The functions and data I used to populate db.json is in load.js and data.txt, respectively. Although, I only needed to run submitData() on the base elemental data once, I have kept everything I used here for reference.
There are additional arrays of data in data.txt which describe elemental groups that are incomplete because upon my research I discovered contradictions about certain elements and which categories they belong in. This may be because there are at least 3 different organizations, (that I've come across) responsible for how these elements are categorized.


About The Program:

First the program waits for the DOMContent to load before it calls fetchElements()

fetchElements()
    is an asynchronous function for no reason at all but why not. It fetches the data stored in db.json and returns a function which 




Contribute:

TO DO:

1. Finish processing the arrays to update the element objects

2. Figure out how to get the horizontal scroll bar in the table to work. 
    Right now, the data just resizes to fit the tableContainer. I want fixed column widths.

3. Make the "filter by ranges" functionable.
