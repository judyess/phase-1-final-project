DESCRIPTION:
This app lets you search through the table of elements by property.


INSTRUCTIONS:
1. in terminal, start the json server >> json-server --watch db.json
2. start a second terminal and run >> explorer.exe index.html
3. end the session by hitting CTRL+C in the first terminal

Adding a Property to the Elements:
in load.js:
    processArray() is given an array which contains the atomic numbers of elements that belong to a particular category. Then it searches the elements that already exist in db.json with a GET-Fetch method. For each element in that array, addProperty() is called on it. The property being added and its value is hardcoded into the body of the function and needs to be updated with each new array.
    See data.txt for elemental information and categories.

    addProperty() is passed an element object, and the categoryType and categoryValue of that array of elements from processArray() then it uses a POST-Fetch method to update that object to include a new property of categoryType:categoryValue.


HELP:
Should there be any unwanted changes in db.json, you can copy and run the list at the end of data.txt.

data.txt is where you can refer to the propertys of the element objects if they get changed in db.json. Elements are organized into arrays whose names describe the category they belong in. Subarrays represent subcategories.


KNOWN ISSUES:
1. Horizontal scroll bar doesn't become active because the table resizes itself to fit the container. This will become a problem as new table headers are added.
