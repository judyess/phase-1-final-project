Nomeclature for simple compounds.

If the compound has metal and nonmetal elements, the first element is the metal followed by the nonmetal. Metals are named first and its name is unchanged.


(!)Considerations:
Is the compound ionic or molecular?
    if ionic, does the metal form ions of one type (has fixed charge)
        or does the metal form more than one type (variable chare).
    are the ions monoatomic or polyatomic?

    if molecular, does it contain hydrogen? 
        if it contains hydrogen, does it also contain oxygen?


(!)Rules by category:

(category: Binary Covalent Bonds)
1. The general rule in deciding what element is named first is:
The element with the lower group number is written first. 
Except when the compound contains oxygen and a halogen, the name of the halogen goes first.



(category: Only has Monoatomic ions)
1. If the compound is binary with monoatomic ions, the compound name is:
    cation name (name of first element, which should be metal) + anion name (name of nonmetallic element) with its ending replaced by the suffix "-ide"


(category: Has Polyatomic ions)
1. Compounds containing polyatomic ions are named similarly to those containing only monatomic ions, except there is no need to change to an â€“ide ending,
 since the suffix is already present in the name of the anion
